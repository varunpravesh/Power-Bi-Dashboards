# EDR Sales and Cost Analysis

## Excutive Summary
EDR are a company who look to buy and help remove scrap and waste recyclables from clients and then sell these to other providers. For certain items they incur a cost and for others they are actually paid to take away the materials. Some materials are received by buyers who they pay to take the materials away. EDR work with clients around the globe and are therefore purchasing, selling and hauling in different currencies. This report shows that a total of 782 jobs were completed, generating sales of £943,001. However, high purchase costs of £1,162,732 and hauling costs of £393,792 have led to a net loss of £613.52K. This indicates that expenses are outweighing revenue, highlighting potential inefficiencies in cost management that need to be addressed to improve profitability.
